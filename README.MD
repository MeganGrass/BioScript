# BioScript
A basic utility to disassemble and compile bytecode for classic Resident Evil video games (for Sony PlayStation).

This version is a complete rewrite from [previous versions](http://www.the-horror.com/forums/showthread.php?9878-BioScript).

Because this version is being completely rewritten, some functionality and game support is currently lacking and subject to deprecation.

[nosysfile](https://github.com/MeganGrass/nosysfile) is required to compile this code.
